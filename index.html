            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I've been programming and teaching myself to program since my early teens. I started with Visual Baisc and following labs from my father's old text book from his college days. Later in life, I went on to learn C and Java to create mods for games I was interested in. In High School I took a BOCES class to learn web development and some game programming, and went on to college at Full Sail University to persue a degree in Computer Science. I love programming and its been something I've been doing for a long time. I view programming as solving logic puzzles where anything you can think of can be programmed and solving that problem is part of the fun!</p>
